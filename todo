------ Visual stuff ------
* Add some way to select range (this is important)
* Add better (visual) error reporting
* Add inner tens
* Add some way to select single lanes
* Add something to fill blank screen

------- Data format stuff -------
* Need UTF8 in order to work well locally
    * Check if this is OK implementation-wise
    * Report to Øyvind

* Move targetID to series, this means that coordinate conversion can be done in
  Series parser
  Makes sense, since series data might be unvalidated by changed targetID
  This is implemented, but not reported to Øyvind

------ Stuff that would be nice to have ------
* handle stray bootstrap update events
* error checking
    * within LiveShot, shouldn't crash upon faulty data

* Experiment with older versions of IE, they are slow, and not always rendering
  the text
* Don't need to redraw the entire card every time?

* Add target rendering caching
    * Can be done using getImageData, but this doesn't work with EXCanvas

* Sometimes it says 'Loading components' or something
