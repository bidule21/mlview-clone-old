* handle stray bootstrap update events
* Add inner tens to liveshot
* error checking
    * Within LiveShot, shouldn't crash upon faulty data
* Something to fill blank screen
* Hover over lane enlarges it
* Click lane to show it fullscreen
    * Has scroller below to select a few targets
* Add target rendering caching

* Move targetID to series, this means that coordinate conversion can be done in
  Series parser
  Makes sense, since series data might be unvalidated by changed targetID

* Use mm instead of normalized coordinates
    * Disadvantages:
        * need to have marker size, at least needs indicator whether to use
            marker around gauge
        * scaling is more complicated
